# Lit Small Grants
## About
We're looking for projects that have implemented Lit and are looking to build additional functionality on their project or support the Lit ecosystem through certain improvements.

## Audience
These grants are intended for individuals, small teams, researchers, and educators.

## Qualifications
Small grants are intended to be easy to apply for, evaluate, and administer. Projects must meet these 5 criteria:

1. You've already built something using Lit Protocol.
2. You can provide a clear plan of what you will do with grant support.
3. You can complete this work within 2 months.
4. You agree to open-source this work, via MIT license for code or CC-BY-SA 3.0 license for content.
5. You agree to complete weekly updates and a grant report upon conclusion.

We may also contact you about promoting the resulting work, including coverage on the Lit Blog or social media.

## Examples of Small Grants Projects
1. Technical Protocol Improvements

3. Community Contributions
* Creating content (guides, translations, blogs, documentation)
