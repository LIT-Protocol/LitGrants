# Lit Grants

The Lit grant program is looking to fund projects that improve developer experience and community development in the web3 ecosystem. We want to support those who are building the infrastructure and applications that will make it easier for people to use and develop Lit-enabled applications. 

Get inspired by taking a look at our [Ecosystem Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/LIT-Protocol/projects/2) page.

## Small Grants
Capped at $2.5K USD, small grants are aimed at projects that are limited in scope, in early stages or have a short timeline. These grants are for smaller teams (individual developers, non-profits, and/or researchers). We are looking for projects that have implemented Lit into a project and are looking to prototype or build additional functionality. 

We would also love to support education within the web3 ecosystem. We are looking for tutorials, guides, video pieces, and visuals that incorporate Lit.

Projects are expected to be complete within 2 months.

## Open Grants
Do you have a project idea that will advance the Lit Protocol ecosystem? We're looking for projects that will significantly increase Lit Protocol's adoption and open use new use cases for the project. We ask that the Lit specific code is open source and made available for use by other developers. 

There will be an in depth review process and feedback, at this point we are capping this grant at $10K USDC. If your project requiers more funding, we will try our best to source additional funding through partners.

Project Grants are targeted toward projects with multiple phases, longer timelines, complex needs and greater financial or operational overhead.

## Event Sponsorships
We accept sponsorship requests for events focused on Lit's technology and community through our small grants program. The events are expected to be developer centered!


### Help! My project doesn't fit in any of the categories above...
If you have a project that you think would benefit the Lit community, but don't fit into any of the categories, we encourage you to reach out to our team on [Discord](https://litgateway.com/discord). We are committed to supporting projects that make a positive impact on the web3 ecosystem, and we look forward to reviewing your proposal!
