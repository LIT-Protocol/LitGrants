# Lit Open Grants
## About
Do you have a project idea that will advance the Lit Protocol ecosystem? We're looking for projects that will significantly increase Lit Protocol's adoption and open use new use cases for the project.

Proposals should include deliverables, milestones, and funding requests. If the specific scope of the project changes, please update the grants team as soon as possible. Continuation of grant support must be approved by the Lit grants team. 

Here are some ideas of proposals we have in mind: 
- **Integration and adoption**: We are interested in supporting the growth of Lit and related technologies via integration into existing app or projects with significant usage. Technical assistance is also available. [`grants:integration-dev`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Aintegration-dev)

- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Make Lit easier to integrate and use! Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Adevtools-libraries).

- **Core development**: With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research, specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:core-dev`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Acore-dev).

- **Technical design**: We want ideas that will improve on the Lit Protocol technical design, for example improvement proposals on the cryptoeconomics design, or on other planned upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:technical-design`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Atechnical-design).

- **Documentation**: Documentation is incredibly important to us and we're always looking for new ways to improve our current set up. We would love to see proposals to create or improve existing Lit project documentation. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:docs`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Adocs).

- **Metaverse**: We would like to support work to advance interconnectivity, interoperability, and privacy at any layer in virtual, immersive worlds (experiences, applications, communities, tooling, standards, infrastructure, et cetera).

- **Research**: We look forward to reading proposals that explore the incentives of decentralized access control. Relevant proposals should be labeled  [`grants:research`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Aresearch).

## ‚åõ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either [`open-grant`]() or [`rfp-proposals`]().-->

Please reach out #grants-questions on the Lit Discord ([invite](https://discord.gg/bBFbmpCX)) or email debbie@litprotocol.com with any questions.
