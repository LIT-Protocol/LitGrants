# Lit Open Grants
## About
Do you have a project idea that will advance the Lit Protocol ecosystem? 
We're looking for projects that will significantly increase Lit Protocol's adoption and create new use cases for the protocol.

## Criteria
**In order to receive a grant, the project must be built with Lit's [Programmable Key Pair](https://developer.litprotocol.com/pkp/intro) and [Lit Actions](https://developer.litprotocol.com/LitActions/intro) features.**

Proposals should include deliverables, milestones, and funding requests. At this current time, the team is capping grants at $10K USDC. If you need more funding than what we can provide, we will try our best help source funding from additional partners.

If the specific scope of the project changes, please update the grants team as soon as possible. Continuation of grant support must be approved by the Lit grants team. 

## Ideas
Here are some ideas of proposals we have in mind: 

- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Make Lit easier to integrate and use! Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Adevtools-libraries).

- **Technical design**: We want ideas that will improve on the Lit Protocol technical design, for example improvement proposals on the cryptoeconomics design, or on other planned upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:technical-design`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Atechnical-design).

- **Documentation**: Documentation is incredibly important to us and we're always looking for new ways to improve our current set up. We would love to see proposals to create or improve existing Lit project documentation. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`grants:docs`](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/labels/grants%3Adocs).

- **Metaverse**: We would like to support work to advance interconnectivity, interoperability, and privacy at any layer in virtual, immersive worlds (experiences, applications, communities, tooling, standards, infrastructure, etc...).
